# Hello
# Play Doz

Play Doz is a Telegram bot that allows two users to play tic-tac-toe in any chat. It is written in Python using the `python-telegram-bot` module.

## Installation

To install Play Doz, you need to have Python 3 and `pip` installed on your system. Then, you can clone this repository and install the required dependencies:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/firstgnome/play_doz_2.py.git
cd play_doz_2.py
pip install -r requirements.txt

You also need to create a Telegram bot and get its token from the @BotFather account. You can follow these steps to generate a token4. Once you have the token, you can replace the BOT_TOKEN value in the code with it.

Usage
To run Play Doz, you can execute the following command in the terminal:

python play_doz_2.py

Then, you can start a conversation with your bot on Telegram and invite another user to join. To start a game, type /start in the chat and follow the instructions. The bot will display a board with numbers from 1 to 9, corresponding to the positions on the board. To make a move, enter a number between 1 and 9 that is not already taken. The game will end when one player has three marks in a row, column, or diagonal, or when the board is full.
